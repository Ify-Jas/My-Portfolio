My First Portfolio

## Description

This week's challenge was to create a portfolio webpage to showcase some of our work. I did this by incorporating most of the key topic learnt so far in HTML and CSS.

I structured my index.html page in such a way it can be easily understood and maintained. I followed the top to bottom reading mechanism. I tried as much as possible to reduce the use of classes and other repetitions which was not always so easy. 

The CSS contains a lot more work than I initially envisaged but with a lot of work, I believe I was able to achieve most of the things I set out to achieve. 
1. I used the same top to bottom mechanism to create the CSS file to make it easy to track sections of the page. 
2. The CSS file contains comments to help the reader understand the parts of the page they are looking at.
3. I incorporated both a flex box and a grid.
4. I used my hyperlinks properly including the use of ID to link sections of the main page to the links on the navigation bar.
5. I used the :Hover to make lay emphasis on my links
6. I used Media Query to increase the responsiveness of my webpage especially when viewed on a smaller device.

In general, this work was very challenging but I also enjoyed it cause I learnt a lot trying to incorporate certain elements and also debugging. I am happy with the final work and will surely be updating it in the future.
